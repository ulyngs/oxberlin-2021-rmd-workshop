<!-- Here's some example calculations using the built-in 'cars' dataset that you can drop in to the report if you're not familiar with R -->

# Including images
Use `knitr::include_graphics` to include the image figures/1920_car.jpg

```{r}
### write your code here
# knitr::include_graphics(some-path-to-an-image)
```


# Including plots
Use the built-in data set `pressure` to include a plot with `plot(pressure)`

# Including tables
Use the `knitr::kable` function to include a table of the `cars` dataset.

# Including calculations inline
Report the mean value of the "speed" column in the `cars` dataset using inline code.

```{r}
mean(cars$speed)
```
