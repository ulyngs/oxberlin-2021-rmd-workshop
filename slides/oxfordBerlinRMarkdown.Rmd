- I'm Ulrik, and this workshop is about how to use R Markdown to make reproducible research easy and fun!
- I assume there will have been some mention of this in the workshop on Monday on reproducible workflows in R, but here we'll go a bit more into depth
- before I say more, I'll start by showing a clip from my favourite scary movie

# Code chunks

![](figures/chunk-parts.png)
--

**Some common chunk options** (see e.g. [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html))
- `echo`: whether or not to display code in knitted output
- `eval`: whether or to to run the code in the chunk when knitting
- `fig.cap`: figure caption

---
class: larger-body
# Typical chunks
### Setup chunk
````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
# don't show code unless we explicitly set echo = TRUE
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
```
````

--
- Normally, an R Markdown document starts with a chunk that's used to set some options and load required libraries.

--
- `knitr::opts_chunk$set` sets default options for all chunks.

<br>

- Gotcha: when using [`kable`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.21/topics/kable), captions  are set inside the `kable` function

--
- The `kable` package is often used with the [`kableExtra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) package
- A number of other packages are available for making pretty tables, see [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html)

# Inline code

--
Inside your text you can include code with the syntax <span>&#96;</span>r code here&#96;.


--
For example, <span>&#96;</span>r 4 + 4&#96; would output `r 4 + 4` in your text.

--
```{r, echo = TRUE}
as_tibble(cars)
```

--
.pull-left[
There are <span>&#96;</span>r nrow(cars)&#96; rows in the `cars` dataset.

# Inline code with python

--
[At the moment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47818461/is-there-a-way-in-knitr-to-evaluate-inline-code-chunks-of-other-languages), syntax like <span>&#96;</span>python code here&#96; is not valid.


--
However, you can use the [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/r_markdown.html) package to access variables from python chunks.

--
````markdown
`r ''````{python}
my_number = 4 + 8

print(my_number)

```
````

```{python}
my_number = 4 + 8
print(my_number)
```

--
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
library(reticulate)

py$my_number

```
````

```{r}
py$my_number
```

--
Inline you can then refer to this python variable with <span>&#96;</span>r py$my_number&#96; - `my_number` is `r py$my_number`.

3. What other options are available to control if a code block is executed and what results are inserted in the finished report? (Hint: see [R for Data Science, 27.4.2](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html))

The best way to handle citations is with RStudio's new [Visual Editor](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/).

To switch into visual mode for a given document, use the <kbd><img src="figures/visual_mode_2x.png" width="25" height="20"></kbd> button at the top-right of the document toolbar.

The citations you insert are automatically added to your **.bib** file.

# Cross-referencing
- For most academic writing you will want to make cross references to **figures**, **tables**, or **sections** within your document.

--
- The `bookdown` package added cross-referencing to R Markdown

--
- To enable cross-referencing, your output should use e.g. `bookdown::html_document2`, `bookdown::pdf_document2`, or `bookdown::word_document2`, in the YAML header (see [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/output-formats.html))


--
```yaml
---
title: "Cross-referencing test"
output: bookdown::html_document2
---
```

--
- The basic cross-reference syntax is `\@ref(label)` (simply `@ref(label)` in the Visual Editor)

--
- For figures: `\@ref(fig:label)`, tables: `\@ref(tab:label)`

---

## Figure references

knitr::include_graphics("figures/captain.jpeg")

## Figure and table reference


.pull-left[
````markdown
`r ''````{r cars}
knitr::kable(cars[1:5,],

````

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(cars[1:5,],
            caption="Stopping cars")
```

]


--
.pull-right[
- Refer to this table with `\@ref(tab:cars)`
]

--
<br>
<br>
- **GOTCHA**: Figures and tables must have captions if you wish to cross-reference them.

---
class: larger-body
### Section references
- Assing a label to a header by adding `{#label}` after it, e.g. `# My awesome header {#test-label}`.


--
- Then reference `# My awesome header` with `\@ref(test-label)`


--
- .Rmd: `See section \@ref(test-label)` -> output: 'See section 1'

## Appearance and style
- For fine-grained control, you can supply a specific template to use for the output document:

```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
*    template: my_template.html

  bookdown::pdf_document2:
*    template: my_template.tex

  bookdown::word_document2:
*    reference_docx: my-styles.docx #note: 'reference_docx'

# 3 steps in adapting a LaTeX template

1. Make the template compile correctly with just the template content (watch out for `$` signs)

--

2. Pull in the content you want from the YAML header and body of your R Markdown source file, by plugging the relevant variable into the LaTeX template surrounded by dollar signs

--

3. Enable code inclusion, by adding this at the top of the **.tex** template (otherwise you'll get an error when you try to show code blocks in your compiled file)

```latex
$if(highlighting-macros)$
$highlighting-macros$
$endif$
```

## plos_latex_template.tex
- Dollar signs have special meaning for `pandoc`


--
- in the template document, `pandoc` will look for stuff wrapped in dollar signs and insert the corresponding content in your **.Rmd** file, before the output document is created


--
- `$` is escaped with another `$`


--
.pull-left[
If we take a look at line 57 in **plos_latex_template.tex** we see this:
```latex
% For example, x$^2$ is incorrect; 
this should be formatted as $x^2$ 
(or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]


--
.pull-right[
- Change to this:<br>
<br>

```latex
% For example, x$$^2$$ is incorrect; 
this should be formatted as $$x^2$$ 
(or $$\mathrm{x}^2$$ if the romanized font is desired).

## Plug in information from our **.Rmd** file
- Find the places in the LaTeX template where you want to insert content from your R Markdown document

--
- Wrap variables from your YAML header in `$`'s to insert them, e.g. `\textbf\newline{$title$}` 

--
- To insert all the content after your YAML header, type `$body$`


--
.pull-left[
```latex

# Introduction

"Tribute" is the first single of Tenacious D's self-titled debut album. 
It was released July 16, 2002.
The song is a tribute to what Gass and Black refer to as "The Greatest Song in the World" (often confused as the song's title), which Tenacious D themselves came up with, but have since forgotten. 
It was released as a downloadable track for Rock Band in addition to appearing as a playable track for Guitar Hero Live.
